### 🎯 CSharpEducationCamp
___
#### ❓ This repo is being developed as part of the C# training camp organized by Murat Yucedag via YouTube. Below are the technical details for each project.    

📌 01 - Printing Commands, Variables (string, int) :

*This project focuses on using input/output commands like Console.ReadLine(), Console.Write() and Console.WriteLine(). It demonstrates scenarios such as a menu and customer details using string and int variables, with the output displayed in the console.*

📌 02 - Variables (string, int, double, char), Data entry from the keyboard, Converting :

*This project works with char, double, int and string data types. It focuses on receiving input from the keyboard and processing this data. Scenarios such as unit price and total price calculations, passenger information and gender selection are demonstrated with console outputs. It also showcases data conversion techniques, such as converting string inputs into integers and doubles for calculations.*

📌 03 - If else, Switch Case :

*This project focuses on the use of if-else structures, switch-case statements and modulus operations. Conditional decisions were made based on user inputs and character data was used for symbol-based decision-making.  
For example; password validation, odd/even number check, country and capital city verification, average score calculation and evaluation, menu item selection, day determination using switch-case and a simple calculator.*

📌 04 - Loops (For, While) :

*This project focuses on the use of for loops, while loops and decision-making processes with loops. Various operations were performed using loops based on user inputs.  
For example; tasks included printing numbers up to a certain value based on specific conditions, calculating sums, checking for odd/even numbers and counting multiples of 7 up to a given number. Additionally, the sum of the digits of a three-digit number was calculated.*

📌 05 - Star Patterns Using Loops :

*In this project, various star shapes were drawn using loops. Different arrangements of stars were printed.  
For example; tasks included printing 10 stars vertically and horizontally, creating right triangles, inverted triangles, combining right and inverted triangles, as well as drawing pyramids, inverted pyramids and diamond shapes. These applications demonstrate how to use nested loops effectively.*

📌 06 - Arrays, Examples, Get value from client, Array Methods :

*In this project, basic examples of arrays were presented. It demonstrated how to create arrays, assign values to their elements and perform operations on arrays using loops.  
For example; tasks included displaying array elements, finding the sum of all elements, determining the maximum and minimum values, sorting and reversing arrays. There were also examples of creating arrays with user inputs and performing operations on these arrays.*  

📌 07 - Foreach Loop, Average Exam Score Practice :

*In this project, the use of the foreach loop to operate on arrays and lists was demonstrated. It showed how to print elements of different data types, perform filtering with conditional statements and calculate sums.  
Additionally, an example application was developed where the user is prompted to enter the number of students along with their names and exam scores. The average of the entered exam scores is calculated and the information about whether the student passed or failed the course is presented to the user.*

📌 08 - Methods and Parameters: Void, Return and Different Combinations :

*In this project, methods that take parameters and those that do not, as well as methods that return values and those that do not, were demonstrated using int and string variables. The application calculates exam results based on student names and scores provided by the user, determining whether the student passed or failed.*

📌 09 - Database Connection :  

*In this project, an ADO.NET approach was used to retrieve data from a SQL Server database. The system displays category information by connecting to a sample database named EducationCampDb. After establishing a connection using SqlConnection, it performs a query through SqlCommand, retrieves data with SqlDataAdapter and presents the results in the console via DataTable.*  

📌 10 - Database CRUD :  

*This project includes an application that performs basic database operations such as adding categories, adding, listing, updating and deleting products using ADO.NET. User inputs are processed with SQL parameters and saved to the "TBL_Category" and "TBL_Product" tables.*
